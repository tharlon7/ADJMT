Problem Definition: 
The Relationship Managers (RMs) for a major travel company perform sales of holiday packages for their customers. However, the system operation is complicated by the varying number and nature of these holiday packages. Call routing and flow control are also not adjusted to RMs skills and customers profiles, making the process of selling holiday packages inefficient. 
Objectives: 
Develop an information system to improve the operation of the major travel company’s in-house call management centre (CMC). 
For the outbound calls, the system will create a target list for each RM based on their skills and profile. 
For inbound calls, the system will connect end-customers to RMs through matching techniques.

Increase customer satisfaction 
Increase RMs satisfaction
